Reasons I chose to create this project:
1. This allowed me to learn more about React through the development of the
   features in the project, all of which were all like side-projects on their
   own.  As this was the first React project I had ever written it taught me a
   lot about what React has to offer.  Although the design approach may have
   been experimental and not without flaw, this was very helpful to me in
   discovering when and where to implement certain strategies and React hooks.
2. I wanted to work on creating and designing responsive and visually appealing
   UI layouts.

##### The goals I had for my SCSS code were:
 - To not use any px units as px units are not good for creating a responsive
   design.  Get more comfortable with and gain a deeper understanding of em/rem
   units.
 - Use a style linter.  I used [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
 - Use more CSS grid as I found myself defaulting to a lot of display: flex....
   in my code and wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the benefits and
   nuance of CSS grid.
 - Learn more about some of the SCSS features I did not know much about.  I made
   a point to use and understand: @use, @forward, imported global variables, and
   mixins
